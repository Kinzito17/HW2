<h1> Homework 2</h1>

<h2> Information<h2>
  
  <p> In this portfolio project I was tasked with making three separate HTML pages. The CSS styling for the pages could be completed in-line or by a linked style sheet, I linked. The project used bootstrap for outlining the pages created using bootstrap elements and grid system. Each page ,index, portfolio & contact, must match the structure of the examples given in the assets folder. Otherwise styling was to my discretion.</p>
